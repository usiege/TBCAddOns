## About

First of all I'd just like to mention that I am not the original creator of this addon, and for that you can thank [Neuro for his old rework](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info5546-eCastingBar.html), [Retloldin for his BFA fork](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ecastingbar-bfa), and [all of the past contributors of the project](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/e-casting-bar-for-wo-w-2-0). This wasn't just a simple TOC edit, so if you have any problems feel free to [submit any issues](https://github.com/shoestare/eCastingBarClassic/issues).
