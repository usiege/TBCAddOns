# BigBrainTanking

## Features
* Automatic salvation removal
* Announcements (Interrupts, Misses, Resists, Activation for key abilities)
  * Custom messages
  * Custom channels
  * Detailed announcements (hp lost after last stand, spell durations, target names with raid marks, etc)

## Planned
* Support for items (Lifegiving Gem, etc)

* Druid and Paladin support
* Display cooldowns for all the tanks in the raid (last stand, shield wall, etc)

Suggestions to what should be added are welcome.

## Supported Languages
Since the combat logs have no spell ID in classic, the ability names need to be known for specific languages. Therefore translations for the abilities are required for it to work.

New translations are welcome, please look into the "Locales/BigBrainTanking-enUS.lua" file if you would like to contribute.

### Currently supported
* English
* Chinese
